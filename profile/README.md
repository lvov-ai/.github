## 🔬 Focus Areas

- **🤖 LLM Agents** — LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI agents and toolchains.
- **📚 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** — structuring and retrieving private knowledge bases.
- **🧠 Open Source LLMs** — integration of LLAMA 2, Mistral, and other open models.
- **🔧 AI Automation** — connecting LLMs to APIs, CRMs, web automation, and workflows (n8n, browser agents).
- **🧪 AI Experiments & Research** — tokenization, embeddings, vector stores, pipelines.
